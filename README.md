# Arthemy_Live-Tuner-SDXL-ComfyUI
ComfyUI nodes useful to Tweak SDXL, Illustrious, and NAI models by adjusting specific 'slices'. These nodes break the U-Net and CLIP into areas of application (like Style, Lighting, Word Logic...) and use sliders to boost or lower the intensity of any of those sections without training.
